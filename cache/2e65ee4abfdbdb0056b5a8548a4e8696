Landestoy and S.B. Hedges pers. comm. 2016). Additionally, mining is ongoing in this region and a major tourist development is planned that will encompass the majority of this lizard's range (M. Landestoy and S.B. Hedges pers. comm. 2016).","conservationmeasures":"There are no known species-specific conservation measures in place for this species.
