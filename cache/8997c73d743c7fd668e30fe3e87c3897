In the Caucasus it occurs between 1,200-2,200 asl but on damper northern slopes it can grow between 600-800 m asl and in Turkey its altitudinal range is between 200-1,900 m (Browicz 1982).","threats":"<p>Even though the wood is highly prized, logging has not had a significant detrimental impact on the population. However, the habitat of&#160; <em>A. nordmanniana</em> ssp. <em>equi-trojani</em> is in decline due to a number of negative effects including acid rain, fire, local timber extraction and habitat degradation associated with large visitor numbers in Kazdagi National Park (Satil 2009).</p>  <span><span><span></span>","conservationmeasures":"This species is known from several protected areas.","usetrade":"An important timber tree in the Caucasus and Turkey where it is highly valued for its straight grain and easily workable wood for building materials, especially veneer (Farjon 2010). It is used as a commercial plantation tree in many European countries where it is often grown for the Christmas Tree market."}]}
