{"name":"histioteuthis corona","result":[{"species_id":176075,"taxonomicnotes":null,"rationale":"<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Histioteuthis corona</span> is an oceanic species which has been assessed as Least Concern, as it has a wide geographic distribution making it less susceptible to human impact. However, further research is recommended in order to determine the precise distribution, population dynamics, life history and ecology, and potential threat processes affecting this species.","geographicrange":"This species occurs in the Atlantic ocean (Voss <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">et al.</span> 1998).","population":"There is no population information available for this species.","populationtrend":"unknown","habitat":"This species is only found in the Atlantic where its depth distribution ranges from the upper 100 to 1,500 m in depth (Voss <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">et al.</span> 1998). Small juveniles have been taken between 200 and 500 m at night, and 410 to 700 m during the day (Voss <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">et al.</span> 1998). Large individuals have been collected between 375-2,000 m&#160; (Voss <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">et al.</span> 1998). Mature females are unknown (Voss <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">et al.</span> 1998). Mature males (110-188 mm in mantle length) have short spermatophores (4.2-5.7 mm in length) (Voss <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">et al.</span> 1998). Overall, little is known about the biology and ecology of this species.<br/><br/>  Histioteuthids typically undergo diel vertical migrations and often occur in high abundances (Voss <em>et al.</em> 1992). Sexually mature adults often demonstrate changes in photophore and body morphology, and descend to deeper depths (e.g. to more than 2,000 m in depth; Voss <em>et al.</em> 1998, Young and Vecchione 2007). Mating probably occurs at deep depths, although spawning may occur either at deep depths or in near surface waters depending on species (Voss <em>et al.</em> 1998). They are important in the diets of a variety of marine mammals, seabirds and fish (Voss <em>et al.</em> 1998).","threats":"The threats to this species are not known.","conservationmeasures":"There are no species-specific conservation measures in place for this species.
