{"name":"trisopterus capelanus","result":[{"species_id":49911704,"taxonomicnotes":"<em>Trisopterus capelanus</em>&#160;was previously considered the Mediterranean sub-species of <em>T. minutus</em>&#160;(<em>T. m. capelanus</em>) and has since been elevated to the status of a fully valid species<em>&#160;</em>(Mattiangeli&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2000, Delling&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011, Gonzalez&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012).","rationale":"<em>Trisopterus capelanus</em> is restricted to the Mediterranean Sea, where it is one of the most abundant endemic species. There is no known large-scale fishery for <em>T. capelanus</em>,&#160;although it is harvested in some regions as a food source and it is a bycatch of trawl and purse seine fisheries.&#160;It occurs at depths ranging from zero to 450 meters, but is more abundant at depths of 50 to 150 metres with a preferences for mixed sand and mud bottoms.&#160;Monitoring of the harvest levels and population numbers of this species is needed, so that any change in the levels of exploitation can be noted. Fishing mortality, both direct and indirect, is not thought to be a major threat at this time and there are no other known widespread threats.&#160;This entirety of the depth range and the preferred habitat of this species (sandy-muddy bottoms) are accessible to trawling. <em>Trisopterus capelanus</em> has become a major commercial species and has been increasingly exploited since the late 1980s. Once exclusively considered a bycatch species, it is now targeted in parts of its range, particularly in the eastern Mediterranean and the Catalan coast. Mediterranean fisheries are characterized as multi-species fisheries, and in addition to being directly targeted this species is retained as bycatch, particularly in Hake and Red Mullet fisheries, both of which are considered largely overexploited throughout the region. Overexploitation of<em> T. capelanus </em>has been observed as early as 1988, in the Straits of Sicily. In the Adriatic Sea <em>T. capelanus</em> is also experiencing high fishing pressure, which has caused significant reductions in total length (maximum observed size of 21.5 cm, vs. maximum recorded size of 32 cm) and a low proportion of specimens older than three years old catches. This species has a maximum observed age of six years and is likely sexually mature by ages one to two, however age of first maturity has not been confirmed. The overall trend in landings declared to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is one of gradual increase to a peak of 3,290 tonnes in 2006. From 2006 to 2001, landings declined by 46% to 1,751 tonnes. There is little biological information available and stock assessments are not performed on this species. It appears to be experiencing localized overfishing in parts of its range, however there is not currently enough information available to characterize the status of the population throughout its range. Therefore, <em>T. capelanus</em> is assessed as Least Concern.<p></p>","geographicrange":"<em>Trisopterus capelanus</em>&#160;is restricted to the Mediterranean Sea, where it&#160;occurs in Spanish waters such as Gulf of Valencia (Salome Morte&#160;<em style=\"font-family: arial, verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">et al.</em>&#160;2001) and Catalan Sea (Bozzano <em>et al</em>.&#160;2005), Gulf of Lion (Gaertner&#160;<em>et al.</em>1998) and perhaps the Ligurian Sea, Tyrrhenian Sea (Dremiere&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1999), south Adriatic Sea (Dremiere<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;1999), east Ionian Sea (Mytilineou <em>et al</em>.&#160;2005), Cretan Sea (Kallianiotis<em> et al</em>.&#160;2000) and Aegean Sea (Mattiangeli&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2003) and in particular in the Gulf of Euboikos (Politou and Papaconstantinou 1994), in the Thracian Sea and in the Themaikos Gulf (Labropoulou and Papaconstantinou 2005) and in the Turkish waters (Karakulak <em>et al</em>.&#160;2006). It is found at depths of up to 450 m, though the highest abundances are at depths of 50 to 100 m (Mattiangeli&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003).","population":"<em>Trisopterus capelanus</em>&#160;is one of the most abundant endemic species in the Mediterranean (Politou and Papaconstantinou 1994).<br/><br/>In 1998 this species was considered overexploited in the Straits of Sicily, with spawning stock biomass per recruit (SPR) well below conservative thresholds of 30% of the pristine or unexploited SPR (Ragonese and Bianchini 1998).<br/> <br/> This species is considered a primary commercial species off the Catalan coast. Sizes ranged from 11.5 to 29 cm total length (Crec′hriou et al. 2013).<br/> <br/>It is considered one of the main target species of commercial trawl fisheries in the eastern Adriatic Sea, with annual catch of about 40 tonnes. Despite its importance in this region there is a paucity of biological information available for this species and there are no stock assessments. Total length in the Adriatic Sea ranged from 10.4 to 21.3 cm (mean 14.4) for females. It is worth noting that the maximum length of this species in the Adriatic Sea is 32 cm, which is significantly larger than the maximum length obtained in a study by&#160;Šantić&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;(21.5 cm male). Additionally, high fishing pressure may have caused the observed low proportion of specimens older than three years old in the catch. Two-year olds dominated the samples (Šantić <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/> <br/> Off the eastern coast of Greece, females begin to mature at sizes of 11 to 12 cm (Politou and Papaconstantinou 1991).<br/> <br/><strong> FAO Landing Statistics</strong><br/> The overall trend in landings for “Poor Cod” in the Mediterranean and Black Sea fishing zone is one of gradual increase with some fluctuations from 1970 to 2011. Landings fluctuate between 500 and 1500 tonnes from the early 1970s until the late 1990s, after which landings begin to increase, peaking at 3290 tonnes in 2006 and dropping to 1751 tonnes in 2011 (FAO 2011) but with no clear indication of recent sustained declines.","populationtrend":"unknown","habitat":"<p><em>Trisopterus capelanus</em>&#160;is found over sand and mud habitats at depths of up to 450 m, though the highest abundances are at depths of 50 to 100 m (Mattiangeli <em>et al</em>. 2003). In the Strait of Sicily this species occurred most commonly on muddy-sandy bottoms between 100 and 300 m (Ragonese and Bianchini 1998). It&#160;feeds primarily on crustaceans and demersal fishes (Politou and Papaconstantino 1994) and has been described as an opportunistic feeder (Ragonese and Bianchini 1998).

Overexploitation of the resource was noted as early as 1998 (Ragonese and Bianchini 1998). This species is now considered a major commercial species off Catalan coast. It is regularly found in northern Mediterranean fish markets (Mattiangeli <em>et al.</em> 1990). In the northeastern Mediterranean Sea, <em>T. capelanus</em> consistently exhibited both marketable and discard fractions in the trawl fisheries (Machias <em>et al.</em> 2001) and purse seine fisheries (Tsagarakis<em> et al. </em>2012). In the Tyrrhenian Sea, <em>T. capelanus</em> is not valuable, but is an important bycatch species in otter trawl fisheries (Biagi <em>et al.</em> 1992)."}]}
